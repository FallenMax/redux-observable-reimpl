# A quick cover of redux-observerble

This repo demonstrates a redux-like state container featuring:

* Manages state and effects in a Redux-observable manner
* Statically-typed with Typescript, userland types (actions/reducers/state/epics) are preserved and cross-checked (see src/features).
* Minimal (and readable) implementation
